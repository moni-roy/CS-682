Fall 2021, University of Nevada, Reno


## Projects

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/moni-roy/Tic-Tac-Toe)

  - The purpose of this assignment is to provide a basic programming experience with an algorithm commonly-used in AI. You should be able to demonstrate the ability to utilize a recursive algorithm in a game-playing scenario.
  
- [Spam-Filter](https://github.com/moni-roy/Spam-Filter) 

  - The purpose of this assignment is to provide a multi-executable programming experience with a discriminatory algorithm that can make decisions using Artificial Intelligence. You should be able to utilize probability in order to classify using a Naive Bayes Classifier.

- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/moni-roy/reinforcement-learning)

  - To implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn a policy for a given task based on task-based rewards. To take a continuous environment and discretize it so that it is suitable for a reinforcement learning task.
